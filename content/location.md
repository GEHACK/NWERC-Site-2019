# Travel
## To Eindhoven
### By air
When traveling by plane, there are roughly 2 options. The first is to fly to Amsterdam and then take the train. The second is to fly to Eindhoven airport directly. Many (budget) airlines fly into either or both airports from many places around Europe.
Flying into Eindhoven airport, a busride is required to reach the city center. Buses to and from the airport (lines 400 and 401) leave every 15 minutes from the Eindhoven central train station.

Travel from Amsterdam (Schiphol airport) is also very easy. A train station is attached right to the airport, with service towards Eindhoven leaving very often, up to every 10 minutes depending on the time of day. The cost of a single ticket is around â‚¬20,- but off-peak group travel is <a href='https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/groepsticket-daluren'>heavily discounted</a>.

### By train
The Dutch train network is quite well connected to the Belgian and German networks, but it is not very cheap to travel alone. For group travel - in off-peak hours - use a <a href='https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/groepsticket-daluren'>group ticket</a> for more affordable pricing.

### By bus
<a href="www.flixbus.co.uk">Flixbus</a> provides transportation to Eindhoven from many locations all over Europe. The bus stop is right next to the university campus and train station.

### By car/parking
As is the case with many university campuses, parking is relatively expensive on campus; luckily a service road next to campus allows free parking. The name of the service road is "Onze Lieve Vrouwestraat", use your favourite maps provider to figure how to get there.

### Other means of transportation
My man! An adventure! Kudos to you! You can find us <a target="_blank" href='https://goo.gl/maps/Thun6eNwqPk'>here</a>.

## In Eindhoven
### On foot
Eindhoven is not a big city. You can easily walk to campus from anywhere within the city center. From the more secluded parts of the city, about an hour of walking is required to reach campus.

### By bus
Eindhoven has an extensive public transport system in the form of a bus network. The network is laid out as a star pattern, with the central train station acting as the hub, which is located right next to the university campus. Most of the stops are serviced once every 15 minutes during the day and once every 30 minutes during the evening, and travel is very affordable. The only thing to be aware of, is that cash is no longer accepted. However, most credit- and debitcards are accepted. The Dutch public transport card also works of course.

### By bike
Some hotels offer a bike rental service, which can be used to get around quickly and to more easily explore the city. Most of the streets have cycle paths and are separated from cars. Just note that many Dutch cyclists view traffic rules as "optional".

# Accommodations
Eindhoven does have many hotels, many of which are located close to the airport, so make sure you check the address before booking; the airport is <u>not</u> within walking distance of the campus.

### Sleeping on campus
Last year we offered on campus sleeping arrangements, but these were not very popular. At the end of summer/beginning of fall we will do a "pre-registration" where we will guage whether we also provide this service.

# Wining and dining
In the city center many restaurants can be found. Mainly around "De Markt" and the "Catherinaplein". Bars can be found at "Stratumseind", which is the longest pub-street in the Netherlands, so there is a little something for everyone.
