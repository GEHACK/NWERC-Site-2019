# General Rules
The ICPC regional contest rules can be found at the ICPC regionals web site; [official ICPC regional rules](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules).

In addition to the ICPC rules, the following local rules also apply:

## Team Composition
A student may compete when eligible according to the [2019 ICPC Regionals Eligibility Diagram](http://icpc.baylor.edu/download/regionals/rules/EligibilityDecisionTree-2019.pdf).

- A team consists of 3 eligible students.
- An educational institution may send up to two teams.
- The educational institutions must be from one of the region member countries. By special request teams from other countries may be allowed to participate in this region, as stated in the ICPC Regional Rules.
- All teams who want to participate have to check-in at the registration desk. The location of the registration desk and the office hours will be announced to the participants in advance.

## Contest Material
We follow the World Finals' Rules, so a team is allowed to bring 3 copies of their Team Reference document, but not allowed to bring any additional reference materials such as books, program listings and notes! You may not bring any electronic device or machine readable media (this includes but is not limited to cell phones, digital cameras, and mp3 players). You may bring pens or pencils, but not paper (these will be provided). Winter coats, bags etc should not be brought to the contest floor.

Each contestant may bring a copy of a Team Reference Document. This document may contain up to 25 pages of reference materials, single-sided, letter or A4 size, with pages numbered in the upper right-hand corner and your university name printed in the upper left-hand corner. Text and illustrations must be readable by a person with correctable eyesight without magnification from a distance of 1/2 meter. It may include hand-written comments and corrections on the fronts of pages only. The document should be in some type of notebook or folder with the name of your institution on the front.

Each team member may bring one printed, unannotated natural language dictionary. You may bring mascots such as stuffed toy animals or party hats (provided they do not violate any of the above constraints). If there is some other item your team needs at the contest, please contact the Head of Jury.

Teams are allowed to bring one keyboard to replace the keyboard provided by the notebook. Note that keyboards with programmable macro keys are not allowed. Wireless keyboards are also not allowed. A (single) mouse is allowed too, but is subject to the same macro rule as with the keyboard.

Keyboard, mouse, and Team Reference Documents should be handed in at the registration.

<!-- ## Programming Languages -->
<!-- Allowed programming languages are C, C++, Java 10, Python (Python 3 and PyPy, similar to Python 2.0) and Kotlin 1.3. -->
